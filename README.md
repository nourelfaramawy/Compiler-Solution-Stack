# Compiler-Solution-Stack
# Compilers Repository

Welcome to the Compiler Tasks Repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of tasks covering every aspect of a compiler, designed to aid in learning and practicing compiler design concepts.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to enhance problem-solving skills and provide hands-on exercises that reinforce theoretical concepts taught in the compiler course. These tasks aim to help closely understand the structure of a compiler: 

  - Lexical analysis
- Syntax analysis (Parsing)
- Semantic analysis
- Intermediate code generation
- Intermediate code optimizer
  
## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific stage of the compilation process. Each folder also contains the task description to provide a closer look at the task at hand. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

- **NFA Construction**: Implementing Thompsonâ€™s construction for converting a regular expression to an equivalent NFA.
- **DFA Construction**: Implementing the classical algorithm for constructing a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) equivalent to a given non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA).
- **FDFA Construction**: Implementing a fallback deterministic finite automaton with actions (FDFA) abstract data type.
- **CFG Epsilon and Unit Rule Elimination**: Implementing the algorithms for eliminating epsilon and unit rules from a given context-free grammar (CFG).
- **CFG Left Recursion Elimination**: Implementing context-free grammar (CFG) left-recursion elimination algorithm.
- **CFG First and Follow**: Implementing the algorithms computing the functions First and Follow for the variables of a given context-free grammar.
- **Lexical Analyzer**: Implementing a simple lexical analyzer.
- **LL(1) Parser**: Implementing an LL(1) parser using pushdown automata (PDA) and predictive parsing tables.
- **SDD**: Implementing a Syntax-Directed Translation to attach rules or program fragments to productions in a grammar.
